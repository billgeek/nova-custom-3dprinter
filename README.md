# "Nova"
Nova is an Ender 5 Plus inspired 3D printer. While I "borrowed" some ideas of the movements, I designed the entire printer using Sketchup.

## Specifications
- Build volume: 310mm x 310mm x 350mm
- TMC2209 step motor drivers
- 0.9 degree NEMA17 stepper motors (X and Y axes)
- Direct Drive assembly 
- SKR 1.4 Turbo mainboard
- TFT35 Touch Screen display
- External MOSFET components to power the hotend and the heated bed
- Sensorless homing

## Build Process
Under construction - I will update the Build process once completed.

## Printed Parts
Under construction - There are a handful of STL files and Sketchup designs in this repository, but they've been updated and are scattered all over my PC. I need to go through all of the parts and update the files as needed.
